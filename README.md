## Development
```
npm install
```
Run locally in watch mode:
```
npm run start
```
Build app:
```
npm run build # or `build:prod`
```

#### Custom themes
You can add a new theme to the [themes.json](https://github.com/daniel-hayes/today/blob/main/src/static/app/themes/themes.json) file. Each new theme requires the following fields:
```
  {
    "title": "My Theme",
    "file": "my-theme.css",
    "primary": "#5dbbea",
    "secondary": "#f0f0f0",
    "accent": "#5dbbea"
  }
```
NOTE: These should be added in alphabetical order (A-Z) based on the title of the theme.

After adding your theme to the themes.json config, you can run:
```
npm run generate:css
```
This will create the CSS files associated with your theme. They will then automatically be accessible in the theme menu.
